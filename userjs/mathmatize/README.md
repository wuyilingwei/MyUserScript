Are you still troubled by missing classroom participation because you were distracted during class? Still skipping attendance just because you don’t want to listen to lectures?

Then unfortunately got deducted from the class participation score for the Mat course?

**Im in class**—just what you need!

### Features:

Sends a Windows notification when the teacher publishes a new poll.

### Requirements:

System: Windows

The webpage will request Windows notification permissions—please allow this. You can find it at Browser address box or nearby.

### How it works:

It detects the button state. When the button displays "Submit," you'll get a notification. Once the button changes to "Update," the notification resets. Therefore, if you didn’t vote initially, you won’t receive new notifications for subsequent changes.

### Notes:

Full-screen or Do Not Disturb mode will ignore Windows notifications, so it’s best not to use full-screen applications, especially those in exclusive full-screen mode.
