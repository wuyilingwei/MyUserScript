This license is hereby granted free of charge to any individual or legal entity obtaining a copy of the licensed work (including source code, files, and/or related materials, collectively referred to as the "Licensed Work"), subject to the following conditions: The licensed individual or entity is permitted to handle the Licensed Work in compliance with all applicable LICENSE(s) associated with the work (if any).
If no other LICENSE is specified, the licensed individual or entity is permitted to use, copy, modify, derive from, distribute, publish, and sublicense the Licensed Work for any purpose, including but not limited to the following conditions:

1. The individual or entity must include the above copyright notice and this license in every redistribution or derivative copy of the Licensed Work without modification.
2. The individual or entity must strictly comply with all applicable labor and employment-related laws, regulations, rules, and standards in the jurisdiction of their actual location, place of birth, naturalization, corporate registration, or operation (whichever is stricter). If such laws, regulations, rules, and standards are non-existent or unenforceable in that jurisdiction, the individual or entity must comply with the Core Conventions of International Labor Standards.
3. The individual or entity must not, in any manner, induce, imply, or coerce their full-time or part-time employees or independent contractors into agreeing, either verbally or in writing, to directly or indirectly limit, diminish, or waive their rights or remedies protected under relevant labor and employment laws, regulations, rules, and standards. This applies regardless of whether such agreements are legally recognized in the jurisdiction. The individual or entity must also not restrict their employees or contractors from reporting or filing complaints about violations of this license to the copyright holder or relevant authorities overseeing license compliance.
4. The individual or entity must not withhold or delay wages and benefits owed to their full-time or part-time employees or independent contractors under any pretext or reason. They must also not refuse to provide necessary labor materials or protective equipment, regardless of whether such pretext or reason is legally recognized in that jurisdiction. The individual or entity must also not restrict their employees or contractors from reporting or filing complaints about violations of this license to the copyright holder or relevant authorities overseeing license compliance.
5. If this LICENSE is violated, the license will be permanently revoked unless explicitly reauthorized.
6. In case of a conflict between this LICENSE and any other LICENSE used, this LICENSE shall prevail, and other LICENSE(s) will only apply if they comply with this LICENSE.
7. Each provision of this LICENSE is independent. If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect.

The Licensed Work is provided "as is," without any explicit or implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
In no event shall the copyright holder be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or its use or other dealings, whether in a contractual, tortious, or other legal context.
